# Theftdetectcnn

Theft detection is a challenging task, especially when analyzing large volumes of video footage. This project tackles the problem by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify theft scenes. Instead of working with entire videos, the approach simplifies the process by breaking videos into individual frames. These frames are then analyzed to determine whether they depict theft or not. Using the UCF Crime Dataset, this project aims to create an efficient and accurate tool to assist in detecting suspicious activities in video footage.
